# Conversion App
This is a conversion calculator app that allows the user to input a value and select a conversion unit from a spinner to convert. When the user clicks the "Convert" button, it performs the conversion and displays the result on the screen. Upon clicking the "Clear" button, the result will return to 0.

## Getting Started

I am using Android Studio with Kotlin.
